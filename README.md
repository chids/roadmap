Roadmap
=======

Text based road maps of things that are either "not started", "in progress" or "done", and may have inter-dependencies, 
rendered as dot

I like visualizing stuff. This is a quick hack prototype of how to visualize "road maps". Groups of stuff that are to be
done in some sort of sequence and might be interdependent such that Foo must be done in order for us to do thing Bar.
